## How to Execute:
Open a terminal and change the directory so that it is in the directory of the
the folder containing the cipher files.

Enter "make" into the terminal.

Next enter "./cipher -cipher name- -key- -ENC/DEC- -name of file
encrypted or decrypted- -name of the file containing the new plain or cipher
text-" into the terminal.

Omit the "-"'s. "cipher name" is the abbreviation of the cipher name utilized,
"key" is the name of the key used in the cipher, "ENC/DEC" is the option given
to either encrypt or decrypt the chosen file, "name of the file encrypted or
decrypted" is the name of the file that will be used as the plaintext for
encryption or ciphertext used for decryption and "name of the file containing
the new plain or cipher text" is the name of the desired output file containing
the newly generated plain or cipher text.
